# UOCIS322 - Project 6 #
Brevet time calculator with MongoDB, and a RESTful API!

## Before you begin
You *HAVE TO* copy `.env-example` into `.env` and specify your container port numbers there!
Note that the default values (5000 and 5000) will work!

*DO NOT PLACE LOCAL PORTS IN YOUR COMPOSE FILE!*

## Overview

Not quite sure why it's not working yet, I believe its when it's calling get_brevet()
